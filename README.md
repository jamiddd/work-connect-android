An app that helps people to showcase their work, create blog related to their work, collaborate with other's work. Basically, Tik-Tok for entry level developers.

Up until now developers had to showcase their talents in Youtube and other websites for people to reach one's Github profile. Usually there are many talented and skilled entry level developers in the world who don't get recognized until they get experience in other ways. Tik-tok promoted the content of even the most unfortunate people who don't have access to resources or simply didn't get the oppurtunity.
