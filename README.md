# work-connect-android
An app that helps people to showcase their work, create blog related to their work, collaborate with other's work. Basically, Tik-Tok for entry level developers.

Up until now developers had to showcase their talents in Youtube and other websites for people to reach one's Github profile. Usually there are many talented and skilled entry level developers in the world who don't get recognized until they get experience in other ways. Tik-tok promoted the content of even the most unfortunate people who don't have access to resources or simply didn't get the oppurtunity.

(A little back story - Hi, I'm Jamid and I am from Guwahati where there is no proper developer community or clubs to join. Not many entusiastic companies that are working for solutions, rather trying to survive by creating applications and the regular jobs. Creative and innovative people leave the city for better oppurtunites, and to join better communities around the world. Although Github tries to remove this gap, github can be a little intimidating (not complaining) for someone who is new to the field and also projects and profiles don't get the exposure. I absolutely do not have friends in this domain. I do have friends but not in Computer Science. You might ask what about the college that you joined, were there not people to where studying the same subject. Well yes, there were, but not to do something within this field. There is a lack of passionate people or the people who can infuse passion to other people in some places.)

## If anybody is interested in collaborating please do.
