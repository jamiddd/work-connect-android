# work-connect-android
(Part of project codesquare)

An app that helps people to showcase their work, create blog related to their work, collaborate with other's work. Basically, Tik-Tok for entry level developers.

Up until now developers had to showcase their talents in Youtube and other websites for people to reach one's Github profile. Usually there are many talented and skilled entry level developers in the world who don't get recognized until they get experience in other ways. Tik-tok promoted the content of even the most unfortunate people who don't have access to resources or simply didn't get the oppurtunity.

(A little back story - Hi, I'm Jamid and I am from Guwahati where there is no proper developer community or clubs to join. Not many enthusiastic companies that are working for solutions, rather trying to survive by creating applications and the regular jobs. Creative and innovative people leave the city for better oppurtunites, and to join better communities around the world. Although Github tries to remove this gap, github can be a little intimidating (not complaining) for someone who is new to the field and also projects and profiles don't get the exposure. I absolutely do not have friends in this domain. I do have friends but not in Computer Science. You might ask what about the college that you joined, were there not people to where studying the same subject. Well yes, there were, but not to do something within this field. There is a lack of passionate people or the people who can infuse passion to other people in some places.)

### IF YOU SUPPORT THE IDEA, PLEASE CONTRIBUTE

## Objective

The main objective of this platform is to boost developer's profile so that it helps the developer get more experience and exposure. Experience in working on real projects and exposure to other passionate people in the same industry. In India there is also the problem of experience, without experience entry level developer gets hard time getting jobs because company usually requires 1 year or 2 year experience with insane requirements. Although every smart person outsell themselves, the fact that the company requires such capabilities, is evident that without experience even in high school level to college level, there is no possibility of good job oppurtunities.


## Main Application UI

## Blogging

### This is not DEV clone and do not compare, before reading it.

Blogging is essential. I have learnt a great deal of things in the internet through many sources. Documentation is always great, but if not for the effort of experienced programmers who spent their time to educate the ones who do not have access to that knowledge, there will be chaos everywhere (Really mean it). The idea of blogging started long back, but the idea of blogging certain specific tech related stuff, really flourished with the app Medium. They gave a platform to people who wanted to share knowledge to everyone. Blogging in this app only differs by the idea of having people of same interest in constant touch within the app. Basically like DEV but with more active approach, such as posting your work for people to see and collaborate <i>specifically</i>.

## Projects

Projects in this app basically mean your work that you have been doing on your own and you wish for people to collaborate, granted you're not trying to hire people to do your work. Hiring freelancers or other people is cool and all, but what about collaborating with other people in projects that can learn in the process. Who knows you might learn something new too.
Collaborating in projects exposes you to other people with same interest, who wants to learn while doing actual projects rather than endlessly circling in <b>Tutorial hell</b> and having <b>Imposter Syndrome</b>. It is easier to collaborate in Github which is meant for collaboration but for an entry level developer, usually it's kind of not easy because the people who are already in the project, are sometimes more experienced (not always) and they require people who are already experienced with what they are doing. The idea of this app is to learn by doing projects with people who are also entry level, but doesn't restrict to the thought that only entry level developers can use it.

One can link all their websites where you have created the actual project. Users can request to join your project. Basically, once they join and know your websites, they can visit and collaborate there.
